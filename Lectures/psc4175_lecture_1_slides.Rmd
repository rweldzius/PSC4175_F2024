# So what IS data science?

- Split into two camps

--

1. .blue[Research] camp

--

  - Focused on **answering a research question**
  
  - Follows the "scientific method"
  
  - Goal: contribute to knowledge
  
  - Domain: academia
  
--
  
2. .red[Prediction] camp

--

  - Focused on **making a prediction**
  
  - Typically unconcerned with theory or *why* a model works
  
  - Goal: inform a decision / policy
  
  - Domain: private sector

--
  
(3. .red[Learning] camp)

--

  - Let the data "speak"
  
  - (More of a subset of camps 1 and 2)

# Course Objectives

- This course is the menu, not the food

--

  - Look over many different fields, methods, and tools

--

  - You pick those you like, and take more advanced classes to dig into them

--

- But we are very **hands on**

--

  - You must download `R` and `RStudio` prior to next class (Problem Set 0)
  
--

  - You must work through first HW using an `.Rmd` file
  
---

# Learning goals

1. Generate a sophisticated research question based on clearly described assumptions and a narrowly defined hypothesis.

--

2. Describe the data used to investigate this research question, including univariate and multivariate visualizations and summary statistics.

--

3. Apply the appropriate methods to answer the research question and evaluate the hypothesis.

--

4. Acknowledge limitations of method and results, and describe a superior empirical setting that would overcome these limitations.


---

# ChatGPT in the classroom

- Are we at the precipice of a new era in human-computer relations?

--

  - ChatGPT can achieve these learning goals!
  
--

  - But it needs to be used wisely...it is still a tool
  
--

- It can make coding (the hardest part of this class) easier

--

- But it can also prevent you from learning

---

# AI in the labor market

- McKinsey told AT&T in 1980 that, by 2000, cell phones would be a niche market of 900,000 subscribers

--

- Is AI-assisted work is the future?

--

  - Profound gains in productivity already

--

- Will this be like automation and globalization for US manufacturing?
  
--

  - What skills will be valuable in 5 years? 10 years?
  
---

# AI in the labor market

--

- My answer: prepare you for both possibilities

--

  - If AI is a "fad", make sure you can do this work unassisted
  
  - If AI is the new normal, make sure you can work with it productively
  
--

- The one thing you **shouldn't** do

--

  - Take shortcuts / cheat
  
--

- You will still have an interview in which you are asked something like the following: "How is overfitting different from underfitting, and why should we care?"

--

  - **You** need to know this answer

- 19 total quizzes, only 15 count toward final grade (four freebies)

--

- Password protected

  - Only students in class can take them
  
  - 50% of quiz grade is just taking it (effectively a way to track attendance)

---

# Not Graded: HW

- You should work through the homeworks prior to each lecture

--

- Open the `.Rmd` file and Knit it

--

- Read the output and try and answer the prompts

--

- **Not graded**, but enormously helpful in preparing you to keep up with lectures

# Teaching Philosophy

# Teaching Philosophy

- This course is **inherently** hard

--

  - Learning `R` is challenging
  
--

- But the goal is to **encourage** you to pursue data science

--

- As such, the **nature** of the material is at odds with the **goal** of the class

--

- My solution: grade leniently

--

  - I.e., lots of extra credit

---
